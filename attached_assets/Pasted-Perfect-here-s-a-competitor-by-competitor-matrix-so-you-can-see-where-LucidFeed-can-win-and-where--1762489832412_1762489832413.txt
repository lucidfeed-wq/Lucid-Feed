Perfect — here’s a competitor-by-competitor matrix so you can see where LucidFeed can win and where you’ll need to defend. I’m framing it from a user’s lens (the same busy, data-hungry professional) — what each platform does well, what’s missing, and how LucidFeed can occupy a sharper lane.

🧩 Competitive Matrix: “Second-Brain” / “Feed Intelligence” Space

Category	LucidFeed (Vision)	Feedly Pro+ (Leo AI)	Readwise Reader	Mem / Notion / Capacities	Refind / Glasp / Matter
Core Promise	Clarity + synthesis across disciplines	AI-filtered RSS, B2B news alerts	Read-later + AI summary + spaced review	Personal knowledge base	Social curation & reading queue
AI Approach	Multi-source semantic graph → context + “why it matters” summaries	Keyword + ML filters (“Leo”)	GPT-based summaries of saved items	None native; manual AI workflows	Simple summarization or quotes
Cross-Domain Insight	✅ Deep: links medicine ↔ tech ↔ policy ↔ culture	❌ Mostly topical filters	❌ Only per-article	❌ Manual tagging	❌ None
Source Provenance / DOI / Citation	✅ Inline DOI + confidence level	⚠️ Source only	⚠️ Source only	❌	❌
Human-in-Loop QA	✅ Expert verification tier (Pro/Research)	❌	❌	❌	❌
Personalization Model	✅ Behavioral learning + attention heatmap	⚠️ Manual training (“Mute / Prioritize”)	⚠️ Reading stats	⚠️ Manual	⚠️ Likes/bookmarks only
Time-to-Insight	✅ <5-min digests w/ synthesis paragraphs	❌ Too many articles	❌ Still needs manual reading	❌ Manual tagging	❌ Scroll feed
Output / Export	✅ Notion / Obsidian / Readwise / Markdown / Zotero	⚠️ RSS export	✅ Readwise	✅ Native workspace	⚠️ Limited
Collaboration / Sharing	✅ Curate shared digests, publish to team / Substack / LinkedIn	⚠️ Shared feeds	❌	✅ Shared docs	✅ Social
Trust Layer	✅ Verified sources, transparent model notes	❌	❌	⚠️ (user-verified)	❌
Interface / UX	✅ Minimal, calm, research-grade aesthetic	❌ Enterprise UI	✅ Polished	⚠️ Workspace-heavy	✅ Simple
Pricing	$12–15 Pro / $25–35 Research	$6–12 Pro+	$8–12	$10–15	Free–$5
Ideal User	Knowledge worker, researcher, functional-medicine pro, analyst	Business intelligence pros	Info hoarders / readers	Productivity nerds	Casual readers

🎯 Positioning “white space” opportunity

LucidFeed’s moat: trusted cross-disciplinary synthesis.

Most competitors either:
	•	Aggregate (Feedly) but don’t synthesize.
	•	Summarize (Reader) but don’t connect context.
	•	Store (Notion/Mem) but don’t discover.
	•	Share (Glasp/Refind) but don’t verify.

→ LucidFeed = “The bridge between discovery and understanding.”

🔑 Feature priorities to outpace them

Tier	Must-Build First	Why It Wins
MVP	RSS ingestion + semantic tagging + multi-source summary engine	Core differentiation: clarity + speed
Phase 2	Cross-domain linking graph (topic ontology)	Creates “Aha” synthesis nobody else offers
Phase 2	Notion/Readwise/Obsidian export	Makes it a daily driver for second-brain users
Phase 3	DOI + source verification badges	Builds institutional trust; unique among AI tools
Phase 3	Team / shared digests	Expands market to research groups & clinics
Phase 4	API / developer mode	Locks in ecosystem stickiness
