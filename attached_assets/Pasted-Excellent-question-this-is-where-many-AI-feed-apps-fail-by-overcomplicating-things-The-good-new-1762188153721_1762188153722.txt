Excellent question — this is where many “AI-feed” apps fail by overcomplicating things. The good news is: you don’t need full API access for all of those sources, and when you do, the APIs are free or easy to proxy.

Here’s a breakdown by source and what you realistically need to launch:

⸻

🧩 1. YouTube

✅ Feasible via official API
	•	API: YouTube Data API v3￼
	•	Use cases: Search by keyword, fetch channel uploads, playlists, or individual video metadata.
	•	Key limits: 10 000 units/day free (~100 queries/day if each costs 100 units); easily extended with multiple API keys or caching.
	•	Alternatives:
	•	RSS: every channel already exposes an RSS feed → https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID
	•	This is public, no auth needed, perfect for passive ingestion.
	•	Recommendation: use RSS for ingestion, API for enrichment (views, likes, transcripts).

⸻

🎙️ 2. Podcasts

✅ No official API needed
	•	Most podcasts publish open RSS feeds; you can crawl via Apple Podcasts or PodcastIndex.org.
	•	PodcastIndex API (free, open) → search by keyword or tag and retrieve RSS + metadata.
	•	Example: https://podcastindex.org/api/1.0/search/byterm?q=longevity
	•	Store the RSS URL and pull new episodes automatically.

⸻

📰 3. Reddit

✅ Two routes available
	•	Official API: requires app registration; good for authenticated features (comments, votes).
	•	Pushshift API (community mirror): good for searching subreddits historically.
	•	RSS alternative: every subreddit and user feed has public RSS:
	•	https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}/.rss
	•	https://www.reddit.com/user/{username}/.rss
	•	Recommendation: Start with RSS for simplicity (no auth, no rate limits). Add the official API later for comments/engagement data.

⸻

✍️ 4. Substack

⚠️ No public API, but RSS is supported.
	•	Every Substack has an RSS feed → https://{substack-name}.substack.com/feed
	•	Pull title, excerpt, author, date, and optionally full HTML for summarization.
	•	If you want engagement metrics (likes/comments), you’d need HTML scraping — better to skip initially.

⸻

📚 5. Academic Journals / Preprints

✅ Best covered via open APIs
	•	Crossref API — publication metadata, DOIs, abstracts.
	•	Semantic Scholar API — citations, related works, authors, quality signals.
	•	PubMed API (Entrez) — biomedical abstracts, indexed articles.
	•	arXiv API — open access, keyword + category search.
All are free and stable.

🧠 6. Other Source Types

Source	API Needed?	Alternative	Notes
Blogs / Newsletters	Optional	RSS feeds	Most platforms auto-publish RSS.
Twitter/X	Yes	none	Currently rate-limited and not reliable. Skip for MVP.
Mastodon / BlueSky	Optional	public ATProto	Later expansion for niche communities.

🚀 Summary Table

Source	API Needed?	Free?	Easiest Approach	Add-Later Upgrade
YouTube	Optional	✅	RSS for ingestion	API for stats/transcripts
Podcasts	No	✅	PodcastIndex.org API	Apple Podcasts integration
Reddit	Optional	✅	Subreddit RSS	Reddit API for comments
Substack	No	✅	RSS feed	None needed
Journals	Yes	✅	Crossref / Semantic Scholar	Altmetric API for impact
Blogs / Newsletters	No	✅	RSS	None needed

⚙️ Practical architecture for MVP

Ingestion Layer:
	•	A background job (BullMQ) calls a “feed discovery” service:
	•	For each topic → pull catalog of RSS feeds + API sources (stored in feed_catalog)
	•	Parse with rss-parser￼
	•	Store normalized item in items table
	•	Optional: enrich with OpenAI summarizer & embedding

Advantages:
	•	No OAuth maintenance
	•	No API cost explosion
	•	No need to store user credentials for third-party APIs
	•	RSS keeps you legally safe (publicly available data)

⸻

💡 Bottom Line

You can launch without any formal API agreements.
All your major content sources (YouTube, Reddit, Substack, podcasts) are RSS-capable, and that covers 90 % of your use case.

Once the product grows:
	•	Add official APIs for analytics (views, comments, author credibility)
	•	Add PubMed / Semantic Scholar for academic enrichment
	•	Optionally integrate OpenAI Transcription API for YouTube/podcast summaries
